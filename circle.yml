## Customize dependencies
dependencies:
  pre:
    - gem install bundler

  override:
    - bundle install:
        timeout: 180

  # we automatically cache and restore many dependencies between
  # builds. If you need to, you can add custom paths to cache:
  cache_directories:
    - "custom_1"   # relative to the build directory
    - "~/custom_2" # relative to the user's home directory

## Customize test commands
test:
  override:
    - bundle exec rspec spec
